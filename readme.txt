== Description ==

*This plugin is still in initial debugging but feel free to try it out but know that there may be some bugs.* Ninja Forms Modal makes it super easy to open any Ninja Form in a pop up modal from a text or image link. This plugim requires [Ninja Forms](http://ninjaforms.com) to function.

Simply use the [ninja_forms_modal] shortcode and pass it the following paramters: your form ID (id), the text or image url you would like to be used as the link to your Ninja Forms Modal (text_link, image_link).

Here is a example of a text link: [ninja_forms_modal id=2 text_link"Click here to fill out out form"]

Here is a example of a text link: [ninja_forms_modal id=2 image_link"http://yourdomain.com/img/yourimage.png"]

Now when anyone click that link your Ninja Forms will open in a very nice modal window. Coming soon we will be adding style definitions for the modal window to the Ninja Forms Layout & Styles Extension.
